        Learn more about our story and values “Bills Restaurant serves
        all sort of meal and seasonal fare with a focus on fresh, local ingredients.
        Opened by native Kenyans, the concept was born by friends whose
        vision was to provide the neighborhood with delicious comfort food in a
        cozy, intimate setting." The main attraction, modeled after the
        Minneapolis-originated phenomenon, the “Juicy Lucy,” features two thin
        beef short rib blend patties pinched together encasing a scoop of
        pimento cheese, the result: a molten core of cheese oozing from the
        patty. Bills introduced their take on the cult burger in 2010 to rave
        reviews. In addition, Bills offers a vast array of specialty crafted
        meals including The Hound, Spicy Patty, and The Mangold just to name a
        few. While we are known for our special and delicious meals, some of our other most popular
        items include our Ringoz, Veggie Burger,Pizza ,Samosa and
        Salad..
